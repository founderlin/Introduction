##### Code Project Introduction:
This project aims to address the issues in on-site inspections, two components are developed. One serves for updating damage information during inspection, the other offers an AR interaction experience to visualize the rehabilitation information. A damage knowledge base is adopted, a specific schema representing rehabilitation information is designed and serialized in the format XML. The AR technology is applied to prompt the user experience with respect to rehabilitation measures display and the damaged area demonstration. Above all, an architecture is established to summarize this research work and propose a more generic conception for mobile AR information management in on-site inspection.

##### Code Project Introduction:
> ###### 代码项目简介
The codes serve for structural analysis using finite element method (FEM). Bernoulli beam elements are utilized to establish a numerical bridge model. Parallel simulation package is embedded in the current Julia release. This research work adopts this package in to verify the proposed bridge damage detection. In the current version, three different loss functions are considered for a comparative study. The results of a previous code version, where only one loss function is applied, is published in the conference proceeding CIB W78 2019, and the conference paper was invited to be extent and published in the journal Automation in Construction.

##### Code Project Introduction:
> ###### 代码项目简介
This prototype is related to an academic article in peer review, and automates the proposed workflow. The cloud simulation platform of structural analysis software SOFiSTiK delivers APIs, which were adopted to implement the methodology. Figure 1 demonstrates the architecture of this software prototype; Figure 2 shows the screenshots of the graphic user interface (GUI).
