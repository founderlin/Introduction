# Overveiw of the coding projects

#### 1.	BIM-SIS APP (Swift + ARkit)
Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/BIM-SIS_app] 
      
The corresponding research project: BIM-SIS
[https://www.bim-sis.de/de/startseite/]

##### Coding Project Introduction:
This project aims to address the issues in on-site inspections, two components are developed. One serves for updating damage information during inspection, the other offers an AR interaction experience to visualize the rehabilitation information. A damage knowledge base is adopted, a specific schema representing rehabilitation information is designed and serialized in the format XML. The AR technology is applied to prompt the user experience with respect to rehabilitation measures display and the damaged area demonstration. Above all, an architecture is established to summarize this research work and propose a more generic conception for mobile AR information management in on-site inspection.

#### 2.	Full Attention U-Net (Python + PyTorch)

Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/FullAttention_U-Net]

##### Coding Project Introduction:
We conceived the full attention strategy to maximize the feature selection. This strategy is implemented in the U-net architecture. The corresponding paper participated in the 1st International Project Competition for Structural Health Monitoring 2020 (IPC-SHM 2020), and was honored with the Excellence Award.

#### 3.	Bridge Damage Detection (Julia)

Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/BridgeDamageDetection]

The corresponding research project: cyberBridge
[https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/cib/forschung/forschungsprojekte/cyberbridge]

##### Coding Project Introduction:
The codes serve for structural analysis using finite element method (FEM). Bernoulli beam elements are utilized to establish a numerical bridge model. Parallel simulation package is embedded in the current Julia release. This research work adopts this package to verify the proposed bridge damage detection. In the current version, three different loss functions are considered for a comparative study. The results of a previous code version, where only one loss function is applied, was published in the conference proceedings CIB W78 2019, and the conference paper was invited to be extended and published in the journal Automation in Construction.

#### 4.	Bridge Damage Assessment via Cloud Platform (Python + Qt5)

Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/BridgeDamageAssessment_CloudPlatform]

The corresponding research project: wiSIB
[https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/cib/forschung/forschungsprojekte/wisib-ein-simulations-und-wissensbasiertes-systemidentifikati-onsverfahren-fuer-bruecken]

##### Coding Project Introduction:
A systematic solution is proposed in this project. In the pre-processing, numerous model variants with assumed damage are automatically generated. These models are posted to the cloud through available APIs for simulation. The required simulation results can be filtered out and subsequently downloaded. Afterwards, the filtered results are automatically evaluated, hereby the real monitoring data act as the reference. A generic architecture is developed and indicates the conception of cloud simulation based bridge damage detection.
