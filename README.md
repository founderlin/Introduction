##### Research Project Introduction:
> ###### 科研项目简介
On the basis of a damage identification with acceptable costs BIM-SIS enables a first classification of the damages with the help of an extensive database of damages and the knowledge of the renovation effort required from both literature and first-hand experience. The overall objectives for the renovation strategy are as follows: To virtually combine the different data of the damage like plans and pictures, in a BIM-Model, so as to be able to assess it with knowledge based methods and develop a transparent and cost solid renovation method.

#### 2.	Full Attention U-Net (Python + PyTorch)

Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/FullAttention_U-Net]

##### Code Project Introduction:
We conceived the full attention strategy to maximize the feature selection. This strategy is implemented in the U-net architecture. This work participated in the 1st International Project Competition for Structural Health Monitoring 2020 (IPC-SHM 2020), and was honored with Excellence Award.

#### 3.	Bridge Damage Detection (Julia)

Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/BridgeDamageDetection]

The corresponding research project: cyberBridge
[https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/cib/forschung/forschungsprojekte/cyberbridge]

##### Code Project Introduction:
The codes serve for structural analysis using finite element method (FEM). Bernoulli beam elements are utilized to establish a numerical bridge model. Parallel simulation package is embedded in the current Julia release. This research work adopts this package in to verify the proposed bridge damage detection. In the current version, three different loss functions are considered for a comparative study. The results of a previous code version, where only one loss function is applied, is published in the conference proceeding CIB W78 2019, and the conference paper was invited to be extent and published in the journal Automation in Construction.

#### 4.	Bridge Damage Assessment via Cloud Platform (Python + Qt5)

Go to the repository [https://github.com/founderlin/BridgeDamageAssessment_CloudPlatform]

The corresponding research project: wiSIB
[https://tu-dresden.de/bu/bauingenieurwesen/cib/forschung/forschungsprojekte/wisib-ein-simulations-und-wissensbasiertes-systemidentifikati-onsverfahren-fuer-bruecken]

##### Code Project Introduction:
This prototype is related to an academic article in peer review, and automates the proposed workflow. The cloud simulation platform of structural analysis software SOFiSTiK delivers APIs, which were adopted to implement the methodology. Figure 1 demonstrates the architecture of this software prototype; Figure 2 shows the screenshots of the graphic user interface (GUI).
